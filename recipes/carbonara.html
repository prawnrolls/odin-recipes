<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon), weight after skin removed</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li> 2 egg yolks</li>
    <li> 100g parmiagiano reggiano</li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li> 400g spaghetti </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp cooking salt</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
    <li> 1 garlic clove, finely minced (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Guanciale – Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
    <li>Carbonara sauce – Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper. </li>
    <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
    <li>Reserve pasta water – Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>Cook guanciale – While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
    <li>Pasta in pan – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
    <li>Mix pasta in sauce – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands! </li>
    <li>Serve – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
