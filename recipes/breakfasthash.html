            <li>800g / 1.6lb potatoes , peeled, cut into 2cm / 0.8" cubes (Aus: Sebago (dirt brushed ones), US: russet, UK: Maris Piper), or other starchy or all-rounder potato (Note 1)</li>

            <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (sub regular)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme (sub any dried herb)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp onion powder (sub more garlic powder)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder (sub more onion)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cooking salt / table salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Everything else</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 red capsicum / bell pepper , cut into 2.5cm/1″ squares</li>
            <li>1 red onion , cut into 1cm / 0.4″ wedges</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>100g / 4 oz streaky bacon , cut into 2.5cm/1" squares</li>
            <li>500g/ 1 lb good pork sausages , or any sausage you want (Note 2)</li>
            <li>Eggs - as many as you want and can fit!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat</b> the oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan-forced).</li>
            <li><b>Toss</b> the potatoes with the oil and seasoning in a bowl. Spread on a lined tray, just big enough to hold everything in snugly rather than spread in a single layer (Note 3). Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Capsicum and onion</b> – Meanwhile, in the still-dirty potato bowl, toss the capsicum and onion with the oil, salt and pepper. Add to tray, then toss with the potatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Sausage & bacon</b> – Squeeze dollops of the sausage meat out of the casings and dot them randomly on top (you could cut the sausages using a knife, but that just isn't as fun). Scatter with bacon.</li>
            <li><b>Bake 35 minutes</b> – Bake 20 minutes. Toss, then bake for a further 15 minutes, or until potatoes are soft.</li>
            <li><b>Lower oven</b> to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan).</li>
            <li><b>Eggs</b> – Push the potato aside to make holes for the eggs. Crack eggs in. Return to oven for 7 minutes or until eggs are done to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
